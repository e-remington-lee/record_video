# This packge contains a modified version of ca-bundle.crt:
# ca-bundle.crt -- Bundle of CA Root Certificates
# Certificate data from Mozilla as of: Thu Nov  3 19:04:19 2011#
# This is a bundle of X.509 certificates of public Certificate Authorities
# (CA). These were automatically extracted from Mozilla's root certificates
# file (certdata.txt).  This file can be found in the mozilla source tree:
# http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/security/nss/lib/ckfw/builtins/certdata.txt?raw=1#
# It contains the certificates in PEM format and therefore
# can be directly used with curl / libcurl / php_curl, or with
# an Apache+mod_ssl webserver for SSL client authentication.
# Just configure this file as the SSLCACertificateFile.#

# create a blisteringly fast UI constraint solver. Chris is still the
# project lead.

# The Nucleic Development Team is the set of all contributors to the Nucleic
# project and its subprojects.

# The core team that coordinates development on GitHub can be found here:

# Our Copyright Policy
# --------------------
# Nucleic uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright
# over their contributions to Nucleic. But, it is important to note that these
# contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the Nucleic
# source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or
# institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire Nucleic
# Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what
# changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate
# their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the
# change to one of the Nucleic repositories.

# With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file
# to indicate the copyright and license terms:
